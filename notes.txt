How well do the 2 top batsmen in Indian cricket (and possibly in the world) bat in partnerships?
Are they able to bat together well and do they string important partnerships with 
other batters in the team?

find the matches in which there is sharma and/or kohli partnerships?

With which other batsman do they have the most impact in the outcome of a match?

include hypothesis testing 
random sample of some matches - do the means differ in a statistically significant manner?

"""
TODO:
1. make sure you're only considering ODI  matches : DONE
2. get 2 dataframes for Sharma and Kohli
    batsman2, total_runs, total_deliveries, runs_sharma
"""


add result of match
add home/away match - was the match played at home?
add toss result of match = % of partnerships that team won the toss
average strike rate of partnership = total_runs/total_deliveries
what about some ODI matches that were played on 2 days? because of rain: 2019 wc semifinal IND vs. NZ
    - are they going to be counted as different partnerships?



how to account for avergaes with small number of counts
e.g 1 partnership with 100 runs gives average - 100!!
