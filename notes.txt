Goal of analysis:
How well do the 2 top batsmen in Indian cricket (and possibly in the world) bat in partnerships?
Are they able to bat together well and do they string important partnerships with 
other batters in the team?

With which other batsman do they have the most impact in the outcome of a match?

include hypothesis testing 
random sample of some matches - do the means differ in a statistically significant manner?

TODO:
1. only consider ODI  matches : DONE
2. get 2 dataframes for Sharma and Kohli: DONE
3. filter files that have sharma and/or kohli partnership: DONE
4. add result of match: DONE
5. add home/away match: DONE
6. add toss result of match: DONE
7. add if India batted first: DONE
8. add if match was played at home: DONE
9. check how recent the data is: latest match in data is '2020-02-11' (this is indeed the last ODI India played) DONE
"""



check if there were any matches where the Indian innings was continued on 2nd day?
and if Sharma/Kohli partnerships were part of it?

how to account for avergaes with small number of counts
e.g 1 partnership with 100 runs gives average = 100!!
